            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I have two main passions that bring joy and balance to my life. First and foremost, cricket is more than just a sport for me; it's a source of exhilaration and camaraderie. Whether it's a friendly game with friends at the local park or a more competitive match, I relish the thrill of the game and the bonds it fosters within my team. Additionally, my enthusiasm for fitness and well-being led me to embrace regular gym sessions. The gym is not just a place to work on my physical strength but also a sanctuary where I can clear my mind and maintain a healthy lifestyle. It's the perfect complement to my academic pursuits, helping me stay focused and energized to tackle the challenges of university life. These hobbies not only provide an outlet for my competitive spirit and a way to stay fit but also demonstrate my commitment to personal growth and maintaining a well-rounded life.</p>
