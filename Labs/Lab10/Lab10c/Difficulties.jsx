        While building this webpage, I encountered a few challenges. Here are some of them and how I tackled them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Learning new concepts about what a component is and how to build them from scratch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Finding a free way to host my webpage.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Difficulties;
