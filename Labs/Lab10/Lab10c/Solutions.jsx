        Here are the solutions to the challenges I faced during the development of this webpage:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Challenge 1:</strong> To overcome the challenge of learning new concepts, I utilized online resources, including the official React documentation and various tutorials. I also practiced building small components to reinforce my understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Challenge 2:</strong> For hosting the webpage, I explored free hosting options such as Netlify and Vercel. Eventually, I chose Netlify for its simplicity and ease of use. I followed their deployment process, which involved linking my GitHub repository to Netlify for automatic deployments.
        </li>
      </ol>
